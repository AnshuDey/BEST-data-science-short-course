# Week 5 Homework
1. Open up the terminal
2. Make a new directory called "week5_homework"
3. Initialize a new git repository inside this folder
4. Start jupyter notebook inside the folder and make a new notebook
5. In the new notebook, use one cell to define a function that does the following:
	* takes some data (your own data, or data from Software Carpentry, or other data you find on the web)
	* has default parameters
	* returns some value from that data
	* uses `assert` statements to check that the parameters are the correct type and output a clear error message if they are not right
6. In another cell in the same notebook, write more assert statements that:
	* check whether the function returns the *right* values when given the *right* data
	* check whether the function outputs the appropriate error mesages when given the *wrong* data and other incorrect parameters
7. Add the Jupyter notebook to a commit and then push it to Github
8. **If your function uses your data** please find some way to include some sort of data in the repository so that I can verify whether it works. E.g., if you have a .csv. or .txt file, add that file to the commit as well.
9. Send me an email with a link to your repository on Github
